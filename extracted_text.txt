Despite the growing demand for GenAL-telated services, clients are increasingly demanding that efficiency gains be passed on to them, creating a challenging pric- ing environment. People are spending more money on new technologies like GenAl, but we nowhave to domore for the same amount, said Venka- traman Narayanan, managing director and CFO, Happiest Minds. Narayanan explained that as GenAl tools, such as copilot, enhance coding efficiency and reduce training time. Clients are leveraging these advancements to demand greater value for their investments.

   Extracted Text: Bangladesh crisis offers new opportunities for Indian textile clusters RAVI DUTTA MISHRA i, January S AMID THE ONGOING eco- nomicand political tensions in Bangladesh, Indian exporting firms, particularly in the Tirupur clusters, are receiving higher enquiries from several global apparel brands, includ- ing Primark,Tesco, Decathlon, Duns,CPenney,GAP, Next,and Walmart, with order conver- sion expected for shipment by early 2025, Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General of the Apparel Export Promotion Council AEPC said. Dueto arecord surge inthe Us dollars value, Bangladesh has faced a sharp depletion in its foreign exchange reserves, which fellbelow 40billion for the first time in two years in July last year. With foreign exchangereserves sufficient to cover only four to five months of imports, Bangladesh has faced challenges in importing cotton and fabric, which ittra- ditionally sources from India. This comes amid tightening economic conditions in the neighbouring country. This crisisalsopresentsan opportunity for additional employment generation.Cap- turing just 10 per cent of Bangladeshs global apparel exports could directly create 5,00,000 jobs and indirectly generate an additional 1 mil- lion jobs in the Indian apparel sector. To seizethe opportunity presented by this develop- ment, India needs to urgently address issuesrelated to capac- ity augmentation and skill development, Thakur said. Most European brands sourc- ing from Bangladesh, particu- larly in the cost-sensitive seg- ment, are facing challenges in immediately shiftingorders to altemativedestinations,due to the distinct cost advantages offered by the country, such as low wage rates, duty-free FINANCIAL EXPRESS nr leshwar Thakur access, and its Least Developed Country LDC status. How- ever, several prominent brands have decided not to further increase their exposure to Bangladesh for sourcing, Thakur added. Notably, Bangladesh enjoysa 10-15 per cent cost advantage over India, as its apparel products benefit from duty-free access in the European Union, the UK, and Canada due to its LDC status. India can only bridge the duty disadvantage after it signsa free trade agreement with the EU and the UK. Cur- rently, several Indian manu- facturers have set up factories in Bangladesh due to Indias labour laws, concerns about unions, and the cost disadvan- tage. Thakur further said that global investments are driven by the political stability index, and the continued instability in Bangladesh presents a sig- nificant opportunity for India to attract investments that might otherwise flowtoneigh- bouring competing countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia. However,with a strong focus on improving and upgrading infrastructure, capacity expansion, technol- ogy infusion, and compliance, Mon, 6 January 2025 India iswell-positioned tocap- italise on these redirected investments. We are also in talks with agencies and con- sulting firms to engage them inimproving productivityand efficiency in the operations of garment manufacturing com- panies, which can unlock the underutilised  production capacity inthe apparel sector, Thakursaid. OnPLI2.0 To capture market share and seize the opportunities arising from the reorientation of supply chains due to Bangladeshs crisis and the China1 factor,India must act swiftly to enhance its produc- tion capacity, shorten produc- tion cycletimes,and improve speed to market, in additionto focusing on workforceskilling and developing a robust com- pliance architecture, Thakur said. Accordingly, the PLI2.0 scheme for all types of gar- ments, irrespective of fibre, with a reduced investment threshold, should be intro- duced on an urgent basis. This scheme would foster invest- ment and scale up production capacity exponentially. For micro-industries, the Amended Technology Upgra- dation Funds Scheme ATUFS should be revived for technol- ogyupgradation,as PLI2.0will not cover micro-industries within its scope,he said. Thakur stated that due to the unavailability of quality Man-Made Fibre MME fabric from indigenous sources, gar- ment exporters are often dependent on fabric nomi- nated by foreign buyers. He added that the existing scheme of special advance authorisation for fabric imports not suitable forgar- ment exporters due to ever- changing market dynamics, designs, pattems, shapes,sizes, geography-specific consump- tionnorms. https epaper. financialexpress.comc765642 eS

The approach helped us to win the confidence of the farmers and understand their needs intimately. We were overwhelmed with their response and they requested us to make superior quality tractors as well. This encouraged us to enter the tractors business in1995. There hhas been no looking back ever since with Sonalika winning the hearts of milions of farmers across the country and globally with its customer-centric approach to provide high quality tractors, backed by a reliable service and spares support We made this tougher by imposing our own self-discipline in business principles and conviction to grow with our self- fesources.

Oneofthe most commendable steps isthe 45-day window provided for publiccon- sultation. This time frame, coupled with the decision to release the draft rulesafter the Christmasand New Year holidays,allowskeystakeholders, particularly global technology firms often operating with reduced capac- ities during this period, an adequate opportunity to participate mean- ingfully in the feedback process. The governments nuanced stance on data localisation is anothersen- sible measure. Rather than imposing blanket restrictions, agovernment- appointed committee will evaluate localisation requirements on a sec- toral basis, ensuring that critical personal data remains within the countrysbordersonlywhen absolutely necessary.This selectiveapproach balances the need for safeguarding sensitive information with the oper- ational realities of global businesses. For example, if the health ministry is of the view that health record of citizens should not goout of the coun- try, the suggestion will be reviewed through consultationsbefore imple- mentation, mitigating the risk of disruptions to cross-border data flows. Equally prudentis the Acts provision for parentalconsentin processing childrens data. By requiring data fiduciaries to verify parental consent for minorsunder 18 through digital tokens, the government addresses the vul- nerabilities children face in the digital world. This model strikes a balance between safeguarding childrens privacyandallowingaccessto digital plat- forms. Itisa more practical alternative to Australias restrictive approach, where children up toa certainage are barred from accessing social media. The DPDP Actalso incorporates mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability. Provisions for voluntary disclosure of data breaches incen- tivise organisations to proactively report incidents, fostering trust in the data protection ecosystem. Simultaneously, significant penalties for non- compliance underscore the seriousness of safeguardingpersonal data.Addi- tionally, the thought that a two-year transition period should be given to businesses to comply with the Act reflects the governments commitment toensuringa smooth shift tothenew framework. Electronics and information technology IT minister Ashwini Vaish- naw has clarified in the past that the DPDPAct adheres to the principles established by the Puttaswamy judgment, which upholds the balance between privacy and transparency. Existing laws mandating disclosure of publicservantsinformation will remain unaffected, addressing fears of diminished accountability. Its a fact that by fostering collaboration with stakeholders, prioritising sectoral needs, and adopting practical measures like parental consent mechanisms, the ministry of electronics and IT MeitY has takena significant step toward ensuring robust data protection while minimising disruptions to industry. But there isa flip side as well. Retention of broad discretionary powers under the guidelines leads to policy unpredictability, leaving too much room for the government toact on acase-by-case basis. This could hamper compliance efforts, asstakeholders struggle with unclearrulesand incon- sistent enforcement.The ambiguity and potential legal challenges may benefit law firms, while businesses and stakeholders face heightened com- pliance costs and regulatory unpredictability. Also, the entire process can betime-consuming, while data protection hasbecome an urgent need for the citizens. Overall, such debates areinevitableand healthy,and the gov- ernment would dowell to fine-tune the new rules further after extensive discussions with stakeholders. Afterall, a lot isat stakeasthenewrules will bringin a massive change inhowIndia viewsand usesthe internet. FINANCIAL EXPRESS 0? 06 January 2025 eS nuoreies https epaper. financialexpress

Market experts, however, arent impressed, pointing out that the fundamental concerns of expensive valuations, earnings downgrades, shallow inter- estrate cuts, and low gross domestic product remain. Theyalso cautioned about near-term uncertainties with Donald Trump taking charge in the US, and the Federal Reserves policy meetingat theendofthe month. The last two days have been an exceptionas domestic, and onThurs- day, even foreign investors are front- loading their expectations on hopes ofapick-upin consumption and bet- ter than-expected corporate earn- ingsin the upcoming results season.

Vk Vijayakumar, chiefinvestment strategistat Geojit Financial Services, said Thursdays rally was totally unexpected given thesustained sell- ingby theF Plsamidthestrongdollar and thehigh bond yields in the US. Leading indicators available so far do not indicate a pick-up in eco- nomic growth. GST collections for December have declined 2.97 month-on-month, indicating con- tinuation of the slowdown.

   Extracted Text: HE ELECTRIC VEHICLE EV revolution has been lauded as a game-changer in the fight against climate change, promising toreduce carbon emissions and promotesustain- able transportation. Governments worldwide are investing heavily in this transition through subsidies, policies, and infrastructure development. While EVs undoubtedly playa role in reducing emissions, the narrative sur- rounding their unblemished benefits deserves acloserlook. Ananalysis reveals, that theEVrevolution isnot the panacea it is portrayed to be. Resource con- straints, environmental implications, and socio-economic challenges raise questions about the long-term sustain- ability of this shift. At first glance, EVs seem likean envi- ronmental saviour, producing zero tailpipe emissions. But this ignores the significant resourcedemands and envi- ronmental costs tied to their produc- tion, especially the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, their main engine. Lithium and cobalt, critical compo- nents of EV batteries, are extracted at a staggering environmentalandsocialcost. Around 70 of the worlds lithium reservesareconcentrated inthelithium. triangle of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, where mining operations are water- intensive, depleting resources in already arid regions.

Worse, the relianceon fossil fuelsto charge EVs could undermine efforts to combat climate change, making the transition less effec- tive than anticipated.

However, India currently has fewer than 5,000suchstations, highlighting the enor- mity of the task ahead. The financial burden doesntstop at infrastructure. Setting up and main- taining reliable charging network isa capital-intensive process, and the costs are often passed on to consumers. This, compounds the already high upfront cost of EVs compared to traditional ICE vehicles. For example, a Tata Nexon EV costs around 15 lakh, whileits petrol variant ispriced at roughly half that. For a country where theaverage per capita income remains low at 2.3 lakh, these costscould make EVs inaccessible tothe majority, leading to eventual snail- paced adoption rates. While personal EVs are a tempting https epaper. financialexpress. comc76555027 solution, they might not be the most efficient path forward, especiallyin pop- ulous countries like India. The environ- mental and resource burden of manu- facturing millions of EVs could outweigh benefits. A more sustainable approach could be in focusing on elec- tritying publictransportation. Buses, taxis autorickshaws,andtrains form the backbone of mobility for mil- lions of Indians Electrifying these modes of transport could have a far-reaching impact and can reduce emissions and air pollution, Citieslike Delhi, whereair qual- ity regularly reaches hazardous levels, could benefit immensely from such ini- tiatives. Electricbuses, whichhavealready been introducedin several cities, demon- strate the potential of this approach by loweringemissionsand operating costs. In addition, exploring alternative technologies such as hydrogen fuelcells or solid-state batteries could diversify Indias clean mobility strategy. These technologies, though still under devel- opment, promiseto address someof the imitations of lithium-ion batteries, including resourcedependency andlife- cycleemissions. The promise of EVs is undeniable, butsoare their challenges. Indias path to sustainable transport cannot rely solely on EVs. balanced approach that integrates renewable energy develop - ment, public transport electrification, and alternative technologies is essen- tial. Policymakers must also address the socioeconomic disparities that could hinder EV adoption, ensuring that the transition benefitsall strata of society. Else, EVs will be like Tesla for most Indiansaspirational. A holistic strategy can help India achieveits climate goals,and drivea sus- tainable and equitable transportation ecosystem. The EV revolution isa critical pieceof thepuzzle, but itis not thewhole picture.Totruly combat climate change and build a sustainable future, India must embracea broader, more inclusive vision of clean mobility.

Demand forwork under the governments rural employment guarantee scheme was at a four-month high in December, suggesting the rural recovery is not as strong.as is believed. The lack of visibility in demand is apparently hold- ing back further investments by the private sector.

In 2023, India retained the top spot with remi tances of 120 billion, nearly two times ahead of Mexico 66 bn and China50 bn. Remittances are critical for any country since they help cushion the adverse impact of any fall in FDI and higher tradedeficit. For India too, the steady flow of remittances has been hugely beneficial and it is estimated totop124billion in 2024and 129 billion in 2025. Apart from the sheer numbers, whatalsoworksin Indiasfavouristhe diverse composition of these remit- tance inflows, which is predicted to provide steadiness incase of economic downturns.

The UAE accounted for 180 of remittance flows, while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Oman,and Qatar, col- lectively accounted for11 of Indias totalremittances. The diversification of Indias migrant pool, between a large chunkof highly skilled migrants workingin high-income OECD mar- kets and less skilled migrants in the GCC markets, could impart stability to remittance inflows in the event of external shocks.

The seeds of change were sowed by Dr Singh, a fact belatedly acknowledged by Prime Minister Modis tribute to him and the Cabinet resolution DR MANMOHAN SINGH, 92, passed away onThursday, December 26, 2024. A con- nection with him that had made on the day he was sworn in as finance minister june 21,1991 came toanend. Manmohan Singh, in his ownwords, was an accidental finance minister. Narasimha Raos first choice as finance ministerwasIG Patel,a respected acade- micand economist. Patel declined, and suggested the name of Manmohan Singh. Many were surprised by the pres- enceof the blue-turbaned,elder-looking gentleman seated in the first row. It was Clear that he would be sworn inasa Cab- inet minister, but what portfolio would the PM give him? Within hours, he was seenat the North Block. Steel within The devaluation of the rupee was announced on July1,1991 bythe RBI.The prime ministercalled me to his office on the moming of July 3 and shared some of his cabinet colleaguesmisgivingsactually, his own misgivings on the devaluation. I natrated the familiar script that the rupee was overvalued, that exports were suffer- ing, that foreign exchange reserves were low, that foreign investors were reluctant to invest in India, and so on. Rao disclosed that therewasonemoredevalu- ation and asked if  would go across tothe finance minister and request him if the second step could be postponed if not aborted. Iwas certain I was not the only FINANCIAL EXP! Few people realise that without Dr Manmohan could not have been launched or implemented Dr Manmohan Singh, emissary hehad deployed. Although sceptical, I bounded off to North Block and wasushered in. twas my first official meeting with the FM.Icon- veyed the request, nota direction, of the prime minister. DrSingh was puzzled  I could seethaton his face by themessage or, perhaps, the messenger. He listened politely and told me that the second step had already been taken within minutes of themarkets opening at 10am.Thestoryof how Dr Singhspoke to Dr. Rangarajan, RBI deputy governor, and the latters famous words I have jumped, are now partofthe folklore surroundingthedeval- uation. That single act stamped Dr Singh  the accidental finance minister  asa determined finance minister with nerves of steeltodowhathe thoughtwastheright thingtodo. That steel was exhibited again a few years later when the survival of the gov- ermmentwas at stake. The proposed India- United States Civil Nuclear Agreement ran into fierce opposition of the Left parties, especially the CPIM.The party general secretary, Mr Prakash Karat, threatened to withdrawsupportto the UPA government ifthe deal was concluded. Many Congress leaders,otherwisesupportive ofthe prime ministerand the deal, hadreservationson sactificing the government fora deal that will any way,be abortedif the government lost its majority. Dr Singh stood firm he told me he would have no option but to Sun, 05 January 2025 2 https epaper. financialexpress.comc76561014 RIP resign if the Congress party forced him to abandon the deal. I saw force in his point but encouraged him to explore support from other parties. In a master stroke, Dr Singh persuaded the former President, Abdul Kalam, to issuea statement of sup- port, and used the statement towin the support of Mulayam Singh Yadavand the Samajwadi party. The bluff of the Left par- ties was called, the government won the vote of confidence, and the deal was con- cluded in due course. Even after the Left parties withdrew support, true to his nature,DrSinghtreated theirleaderswith respect and maintained cordial relations with them. Compassionate liberaliser Few people realise that without Dr Singhs unequivocal support themajorsig- nature programmes of the UPA could not have been launched orimplemented.Two examples, among many, werethe Agricul tural Dept Waiver 2008 and the Right to Food programme 2013. Dr Singh was strongly in favour of both welfare pro- grammes but he repeatedly cautioned me tokeepaneyeontheirimpact onthefiscal deficit. He, more than any political leader, was acutely conscious of the fact that if macto-economicstability waslost,nowel- fareprogrammecouldbeimplemented in themedium orlongrun. When hewassat- isfiedthat the governmentwouldmeetthe target ofthe fiscal deficit, he approved the ghs unequivocal support the major signature programmes of the UPA welfare programmes. Dr Singh was an instinctive reformer but consciously leaned in favour of the poor. He was a strong votary of welfare programmesthat had multiple externalities. He taught us that economicreforms could gohand-in- hand with generous welfare measures. I also firmly believe that Dr Singhs policies createdthe present middleclass.

Profitability will further be dri- ven by the top-up and tank-up phenomena forthe firm,he said,as more professionals in Indialookto acquireadditional skills, and inter- national customers, most notably in the North American market, look to upskill and gain a compet- itiveedge. The firm, which doubled its revenues in FY24 over FY23 is looking at a growth of 35-40 CAGRin future, though growth in the year ending March 2025 will be lower. We wanted to swing completely to everything being profitable. We wanted to see that anything that was too much of a burn for us to get growth, wewill not do it, Screwvala said. This includes dialling back on the university led education verti- cal where the ed-tech firm gets 70 margins as compared to the non-university led modules where margins canbe upwards of 90, he added.

How- ever, for basic tech skill, especially emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, the modules are pretty much the same.

For FY24, the enterprise segment was roughly 20 ofupGradsrevenue,of which AI skill coursescontributed to 20oftherevenue. However, thestrongest contribu- tors continue to be technology and sales courses. For its non-university programmes,upGrad creates courses with educators and industry profes- sionals.Thisallowsit notoniytheflu- idity of structuring the courses, but also margin competitiveness since the intellectual property IP for the said course isowned byit.

Ukraines Energy Minis- ter Herman Halushchenko confirmed on Wednesday morning that Kyiv had stopped the transit in the interest of national securi- ty. This is a historic event. Russia is losing mar- kets and will incur finan- cial losses. Europe has al- ready decided to phase out Russian gas, and this aligns with what Ukraine has done today, Mr. Ha- lushchenko said in an up- date on the Telegram mes- saging app. At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian Pre- sident Volodymyr Zelen- skyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn additional billions... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens. But he had briefly held open the possi- bility of the gas flows conti- nuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends. Russian _ state-owned energy company Gazprom said in a statement on Wed- nesday that it has no tech- nical and legal possibility of sending gas through Uk- raine, due to Kyivs refusal to extend the deal. Even as Russian troops Key link An underground gas storage facility in Lviv, Ukraine. AFP and tanks moved into Uk- raine in 2022, Russian nat- ural gas kept flowing through the countrys pi- peline network to Europe, under a five-year agree- ment. Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine took transit fees. Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40 of the EUs pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pi- peline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through  Turkiye to Bulgaria. Energy crisis After the war started, Rus- sia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Be- larus-Poland pipelines, cit- ing disputes over a de- mand for payment in roubles. The Baltic pipe- line was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky. The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship. Us- ers cut back as prices rose. Norway and the U.S. filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.

The com- mittee, headed by former High Court judge, Justice Nawab Singh, had invited the SKM to join its meeting on Friday. SKM in principle does not accept intervention of the Court because the farmers are fighting on pol- icy issues with the Centre and hence the Court has no role to play.

The tumultuous surf also ripped apart a historic wharf in Santa Cruz, prompting new questions about the future of the states be- loved piers, as the sea grows ever more fierce amid climate change. Every year, state and local offi- cials  often with community sup- port  pour millions of dollars into preserving the spindly wood- enstructures that have been a de- fining feature of Californias coast- line dating back to the Gold Rush. In San Luis Obispo County, part of the Cayucos Pier has been roped off since it was damaged in aferocious storm earlier this year. The partial closure came less than a decade after the pier underwent 3.5 million renovation that was supposed to sustain the structure for several decades. In San Diego, the Ocean Beach pier, a nearly 2,000-foot concrete structure built in 1966, has been closed indefinitely, as city officials explore replacing it after having spent more than 1.7 million on re- pairs following storms over the past five years.

Earlier damage to the Santa Cruz Wharf, which was built in 1914 and is now the longest pier on the West Coast, led city officials to begin a 4 million restoration project this year.

Kathy Hochul of New York on Thursday signed a law that re- quires companies that are big fos- sil fuel polluters to help pay to re- pair damage caused by extreme weather, which is becoming more common because of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation, called the Cli- mate Change Superfund Act, mandates that the companies re- sponsible for the bulk of carbon emissions buildup between 2000 and 2024 pay about 3 billion each year for 25 years. With nearly every record rain- fall, heat wave, and coastal storm, New Yorkers are increasingly burdened with billions of dollars in health, safety, and environmen- tal consequences due to polluters that have historically harmed our environment Governor Hochul said. The law was modeled on the original Superfund law, which was established in 1980 and requires companies to pay for the cleanup of toxic waste wrought by inci- dents like oil and chemical spills. New Yorks new law focuses on pollution produced by the com- bustion of fossil fuels, which re- sults in the warming of the atmos- phere, causing extreme weather, like floods and storms, to be more Continued on Page Al2

   Extracted Text: Mero Shyam kantha Centre puts tungsten mining in TN on hold EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE Chennai THE Ministry of Mines on Tuesday requested the Tamil Nadu govern- ment to keep the process of issuing the Letter of Intent Lol to the pre- ferred bidder, Hindustan Zinc Lim- ited, for mining of tungsten in Nay- akkarpatti Tungsten Block in Madurai on hold. It has cited objections relating to auctioning of the block over the existence of biodiversity her- itage site within block area. The Geological Survey of India GSI has been asked to explore the possibility of redefining the block bounda- ry by excluding the biodiversity site, a press statement issued by the ministry on Tuesday said. TNIE was the first to report about the plan to mine molybde- num and tungsten in Tamil Nadu. The ministrys announcement has come two weeks after Tamil Nadu Assembly on December 9 unanimously adopted a resolution urging the centre to immediately cancel the tungsten mining rights given to Hindustan Zinc Limited and not to grant any mininglicence in the future without the permis- sion of the state government. Speaking in the Assembly, Chief Minister MK Stalin had declared that as long as he is the CM, the state government will never allow tungsten mining in Madurai dis- trict. The chief minister had also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel the award of tungsten mining rights. The mines ministry had earlier said that inputs were taken from the Tamil Nadu government before the auc- tion of the tungsten block and no communication from any quarter, including from the state, regarding any opposition to the tender was received. The statement by the mines min- istry on Tuesday also said that sec- retary of the ministry, in a letter dated December 6, 3, sent to Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu re- quested details of three critical mineral blocks to be put up for auc- tion including Nayakkarpatti.

   Extracted Text:  MANMOHAN SINGH BELIEVED IN GROWTH WITH EQUITY Member of Rajya Sabha RManmohan Singh belongs to an era when politicians were respected for allowing institu- tions to flourish. It is not as if there were no aberrations in the past. By and large, the spirit of the Constitution was hon- oured by those in power. Even when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister 1999- 2004, he respected and heard the voice of the opposition. Narasimha Rao, on one occa- sion, requested Vajpayee, who was the Leader of Opposition at the time, to lead a delega- tion to the UN. It was during those years that Manmohan Singh, from being a bureau- crat, who served the nation in several capacities, became the Prime Minister in 2004. The opening up of the In- dian economy, when a radical shift was made in 1991, by Singh as Finance Minister with Indias balance of pay- ments in deep crisis. His eco- nomic liberalisation policy paved the way for what India is today. Every sector of the economy moved away from the license quota raj and from a 3.3 growth rate prior to 1991, we in the 1990s witness- ing Indias GDP growing at 6. Between 2004 and 2014, GDP growth averaged 7.7 with 8.1 average growth be- tween 2004 and 2009. Those were golden years, when Indias growth story was lauded internationally and 271 million people moved above the poverty line. Eco- nomic growth during these years was tempered with eq- uity. Singh believed that growth without equity, is not the path India should tread. His commitment to Parlia- ment and Parliamentary in- stitutions was unmatched. He sat through the debates, lis- tening to the opposition and attempted, to the extent pos- sible, to move forward with consensus. He did not have the luxury of a brute majority in the Lok Sabha and there- fore, had to navigate his poli- cies through dialogue both with his coalition partners and the opposition. The dia- logues, with his coalition part- ners, allowed him to make some monumental decisions. The Right to Information Act, 2005, brought about enor- mous transparency in the process of decision making. With information available to citizens, government could be held accountable, making transparency a policy pre- scription. The Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, allowed 25 of chil- dren belonging to the poor and marginalised communi- ties to be admitted to private schools where theireducation wassubsidised from Class I to Class VIII. These changes in many senses recognised that unless people at the bottom of the pyramid have opportuni- ties, India will continue to be an iniquitous society CONTINUED ONPTI ee, ALS at930am US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Singh was one of the greatest champions of US-India strategic partnership who brought the two countries closer ASTATESMAN UKENO OTHER PUTIN Russian President Madimir Putin described former prime minister Manmohan Singh asan outstanding statesman who elevated India- Russia ties to greater heights

Analysts say the role of capital markets in financing growth also requires deepstructural changesin theeconomy alongsideinterestrate reform. As part of that process, Chinas governing Politburo last month eased the nations monetary policy stance forthe first time in some 14 years to appropriately loose from prudent, a stance it adopted in 2010.

Early in 2024, the Hurun list of worlds billionaires came out, in which of the 3,279 billionaires, 271 were Indian, Mumbai became Asia billion- aire capital, and Mukesh Ambani, the wealthiest Gujarati, became the richest Asian, at 115 billion. Gautam Adani, also Gujarati at 86 billion, was the fif- teenth richest in the world. Five of the richest ten Indians in the Forbes list of 2023 are Gujarati,and of the top 100, and nineteen more Gujaratis add to a total of twenty-four in the top 100. Other similar lists vary because amily- owned businesseshave fiendishly com- plicated cross-holding patterns.

   Extracted Text: Kissa and kahani Amid countless avenues of entertainment that are just a click away, some festivals are attempting to keep the tradition of oral storytelling alive GARIMA SADHWANI FTHERES ONE thing that global- isation has tried to very covertly take away from us, its our awn traditions, the ones that we grew up with and held close to our hearts for many many ages. Until one day, we woke up and never indulged in them again. One such tradition that hasbeen at therisk ofbeinglost forquite some time now isoralstorytelling. Remember the tales yourgrandmotherusedtotellyou while tucking you inbed,themagicthat mushairas held, the Ramayana and Mahabharata tales recited in your neighbourhoods, and even the extem- pore competitions in school whereyou. invariably fumbled or laughed? Inatimewhencountlessavenuesof entertainment are just a click away, preserving the OGs can be an arduous task, one that might feel too tedious. But there are some people who have held onto them firmly, to keep intact the glory of an almost pious art formone that myths and mytholo- gies hugely relied on, Take for instance, story- telling festivalsKathaalok held in Dethi, Gaatha Mum- bai International Storytelling Festival, Kathakar scheduled to be held in the national capital from January 31-February 2, UdaipurTales tobe held in its namesake Rajasthani city from January 10-12, and Spoken Fest, among others. Held across regions, they have been wonderful avenues to bring patrons of the art formtogether. Says Sushmita Singha co-founderat UdaipurTales Weare creating a space where people can pause, connect, and truly live the magic of storytelling The bond between the storyteller and the listener is something no digital medium can replicate,and that iswhat draws people to festivals Kathakarwill be hostingartists from Poland, UK, Australia, Mongolia and Estonia, among other countries while and mainstream musicians from the Hindi film industry. Prarthana Gahilote, festival director of Kathakar International Storytellers Festival, whichis in its 14th year and settohost its 18th edition, says they also curate special sessions for their festival to bring in schoolchildren, Roshan Abbas, the founder of Kom- mune and festival director of Spoken Fest, which was held in Shillong on December 6 last monthandis gearing up forits Mumbai edition on February 1-2, tells FE that their programming, too, is intentionally structured to appeal to peopleacrassage groups. Theyhold pan- ls showcasing contemporary story- telling, celebrating classical art forms, conversationswithwritersand directors, and performanceshoweases. But its not easy to organise these festivals year after year. Gahilote of Kathakar says, People across all age groups are now glued to their gadgets. Itis difficult to hold theirattention for more thana few minutes Singha of Udaipur Talesagrees.She laments that with people so immersed in the digital world, they rarely get the chance to experience the emotional connection oflistening toastoryin per- son Andwhen theydo,moreoften than not, they tend to capture it virtually rather than be present. All said  done Bringing any crowd, especially young people, to festivals isa task in itself.So the organisersare now offer- ing them a plethora of formats to draw them in and help them discover new talent. At Udaipur Tales, for instance, folk artists, qawwals, dastangos, and even storytellers from Latin America and Francewillbe performing. However, Abbas does acknowledge, Our digital presence has been instru- mentalin engaging youngeraudiences. With 82 of our audience between ages 18 and 35 years, Spoken Fest invitesa lotof mindful millennialsand GenZseekingauthenticexperiences Singha, too, mentions that the nate in bringing in people fromall age groups to thedifferent eventsandpan- cls while also organising some sessions for children, Accumulating funds to organise these festivals is a big hurdle too. Rachna Gahilote Bisht, Kathakars fes- tival organiser, says finding funds isa cycle you could get stuck in. To bring people tothe festival,youhavetohosta magnitude of international performers the production and management costs of which area burden to handle, and if you dont have a specialised lineup, the crowdswont come. With Kathakar travelling to Delhi, Jodhpur, Chennai and Shimla for its upcomingedition, money becomesan even bigger concern. Fortunately, says, Bisht, Since 2013,we have been part- neringwith the Union ministry of cul- ture, and for the past two editions, DelhiTourism hasbeen supporting us aswell Walking the talk But beyondtheseannualevents,the attempt to keep going at oral story- telling remains. Kathakars organisers hold sessions for children in hospitals, schools, and faith-based organisations. With collaboration with NGOs such as Nivesh, thefestival hasalsobeensetting up public libraries toinculcatea habit ofreadinginchildren Whats also interesting is that fes- tivals dont justhelp people engage in anart form they look up to, they also help create future avenues for the artistes themselves. Says Abbas, Weve witnessed some remarkable journeysfrom Mohammad Mun- em, the phenomenal singer from Kashmir who credits Spoken as the beginning of his new life, to Srushti Tawades evolution asa rapper, and Hussain Haidry finding his broader audience. Even established artistes like Kausar Munir have used our plat- form to showcase different facets of theirartistry That said, Abbas does note that the Spoken Fest team is exploring an expansion into schools, to help build

While ARCs havea proven track record in resolving corporate NPAs, they are finding it increasingly challenging tohandleretail bad loans.

One of the major hurdles ARCsare facing is theabsence of a standardised andwidely acceptable pricing model for retail NPAs.

So far, we have not been very successful in that. And whenwe failtodoit,we lean towards the revdi culture of freebies, which runs throughall political parties beitin the name ofladli behna or lad ladki,as was thecasein Maharashtras recent Assem- bly elections. Even now, the Aam Aadmi Party is promising to give 18,000 a monthto pujarisandgranthisif they are voted back to powerin Delhi. India can- not progress with such doles, nay bribes, for votes. As honest taxpay- ers, we wonder how our money is being frittered away. wonder why our Election Commission is silent on such ludicrous promises. Will the Supreme Courtstep into bringsome orderamong political partieson elec tion promises that are damaging our democracy? Mostof these are a waste of taxpayers money, who feelhelplessand cheated having paid theirdue. Coming back to reforming agricul- ture, politically, for the Modi govern- ment at the Centre, 2025 seems a golden chance as the parliamentary elections are far away. The big expen ditures in rural areas, induding agri culture, are going from the central Budget. Lookat food and fertiliser sub- sidies. Both togetherare likely to cross 4 lakh crore, Add to it the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi PM- Kisanand Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MGNREGA, and one would easily ross 5 lakh crore out of a Budget of about 45 lakh crore FY25, All these need to be rationalised, and one can easily save at least 1 lakh crore that canbeinvested backinagricultureand rural areas for building basic infra- structure, ranging from roads and water harvesting to upgrading agri mandisand rural haats. But how do we rationalise these mega subsidies and so-called welfare programmes? The fertiliser subsidy needs tobe mergedwith PM-Kisanand given to farmers directly on a per hectare basis, while fertiliser prices need to be deregulated and freed, Micro-managing prices for each urea plant, and then informally controlling even di-ammonium phosphate prices, whenin theory theyare relatively free, isreminiscentof the socalistera of the USSR. The timidity of successive gov ernment is reflected in the fact that urea prices have not been revisedsince 201 2, whileall other commodity prices have gradually risen. Thisisnothelping either the peasantry, productivity, o the planet,asitisleading to inefficient use and massive diversions. Similarly food subsidy must be tar- geted and given in the form of digital coupons to bespent on, say, 20 nutri tious food items. The MGNREGA needs tobe dovetailed with agri-work and PM AwasYojana.Thewhole system needsan overhaul. Itcan bedone ifthe Modi gov- ernment is boldand remains focused.

Other players, including Zee Enter- tainment Enterprises ZEEL and Sony Pictures Networks India SPNI,have alsorevised their rates, with an average increase of 10. An 18 price hike is unusually high, the largest in the last seven years,according toKaran Taurani, senior V-Pat lara Securities. He notesthat most broadcast players typi- cally raise theirbouquetrates by 7-9 annually. This is a smart strategy, particularly forthe newly-merged entity, asit is the mostlogicalwayto drive up revenues. Both Via- com18 and Disney Star had been incurring losses from their premium sporting con- tent, which they had been offering for free, Taurani added. This could indicate that tthe brand is aiming fora pre- mium positioning, leveraging properties such as Star Gold Network, Colors TV, and Star Sports said an official froma mJioStar has broken the 219 ceiling for two individual channels, Colors Kannadaand MaaTV, raising their subscription rivalchannel JioStar has also unveiled 83 channelpacks comprising 134 channels  85 of which are standard definition, 44 high definition and five free channels. The value pack for standard definition is now 110,up from the combined Star India 260 and Via- com18 834 Hindi pack rates. JioStar has unveiled 83 channel packs offeringa total of 134channels,indluding 83 in standard definition, 44 in high definition, and five free channels. The value pack for standard definition channels isnow priced at110, upfrom the combined rates of Star India 60 and Viacom18 834 for their Hindi packs. JioStar has broken the 19 ceiling for two individual channels,Colors Kannada and Maa TY, raising their sub- scription rates to 25. These channelsareavailableonlyon ana-la-carte basis. SPNIs Hindi bouquet rate has increased from 48 to 854, while ZEELs Hindi chan- nel bouquet pricing has risen from47 to 853, There wont be a major churn in subscribers either, especially not in urban mar kets. Even though networks like Zee and Sony may lose more subscribers than lioStar, the impact of the price rise will be positive from a rev- enue standpoint, observes Taurani. The only negative fallout of the new pricing could be interms ofadvertiser interest,sinceeven the small- est drop in viewership could keep advertisers away.

Clearly, there was significant disconnect between consumers and their personal data and how thecompanies that collectt,useit. The proposed Digital Personal Data Protection DPDP Rules have the capacitytodisrupt this framework, handing theleverto the consumer, Brands must now focus on creat- ing value exchanges where con- sumers willingly share data because they see tangible benefits, not ust becausetheyhave no other choice says Surendra Singh, CEO, Brand Street Integrated. The push forstringentdatapro- tection laws mirrors global trends akin to European Unions General DataProtectionRegulationGDPR that protects the privacyand secu- rity of personal data. While laws exist, the real challenge is not ust theircreation but howwelltheyare implemented and enforced? says Chandan Bagwe, founder  direc- tor of CCom Digital Time to rebuild trust The overwhelming consensus among marketers is that the DPDP Act and Rules will not only reshape how individual brands communicate with their con- sumers but will challenge the broaderadvertising ecosystem. To start with, the Rules mandate a shift from implied consent to explicit opt-ins, Pre-checked boxes and vague consent mecha- nisms wil be things of thepast. By prioritising userprivacyandgran- ular consent, it will encourage marketers to focus on genuine leads. Marketers and advertisers are far more likely torely on intel- PRIVACY REGULATION The cost of consent eThe proposed DPDP Rules challenge marketers to rethink strategy Pee oy Fate ees ts Brae sc Cena ligent as opposed to mass data, says Dhruy Suri, partner at PSA Legal. With granularconsentlev- els,only genuinely interestedcon- sumers willopt-in, improving the probability of conversions Contextual advertising will probablybea bigger dealnow than hyper-personalisation. In other words, there could be a consider- able shift away from targeting customers based on their profiles andinstead focus on what theyare already searching for or consum- ing online. Additionally, withdrawing consent must beas seamless as grantingit.Thatwill force brands to redraw the line between pri vacy and commerce.Marketers thrive on data to achieve maxi- mum reach. The proposed DPDP Rules will require the industry to adapt by fine-tuning and updat- ing their systems, notes Raj Ramachandran, partner at SA Advocates  Solicitors. Seemingly straightforward forms that collect basic informa- tion, such as names and email addresses, willfallunder the Acts purview. Once collected, con- sumer data must remain confidential and used for the Een euReeiccg Poe Kenecnd eC Peo ec iE aes stated purpose.

Even the deletion process requires either automa- tion or manual intervention, which incurs additional expenses. Security throughoutthelifecycle of the data, will be paramount says Bagwe. The financial burdenaside, the Actwill trigger marketers to think out of the box. It will prompt busi- nessestoprioritisefirst-party data, leveraging loyalty programmes and direct customer engagement over third-party data. This shift could level the playing field for smaller firms, allowing them to compete through meaningful cus- tomer relationships rather than sheer data volume.A comprehen- sive ground-up approach will lay the foundation for effective long- term compliance,adds Mayuran Palanisamy,partner,Deloittelndia Ambika Sharma, founder  chief strategist, Pulp Strategy, says whilesmall businesses might face some early hurdles in the form of high compliance cost, in the long run, these regulations will foster trust. This shift will compel brands to build deepertelation- ships with consumers by focusing on transparencyand offering gen- tine value? she says Going forward, brands must align with what Hemal Majithia, founder,Oktomind,referstoas the CARE framework of communica- tion  comprising clarity, accountability, relevance, and engagement. Marketers can no longer rely on vague consent or indefinite data retention. The DPDP Act asks us to clearlycom- municate why were collecting data, how long well store it, and how it benefits the user. Ths isnt just compliance its about foster- ing trust, he asserts. The three- year data retention limit will push them tofocuson the value of expe- riences and products, which ulti- mately builds deeper customer trust, sums up Pathik Patel, founder, D2C brand Fit  Flex.

He was later presented before the juvenile court, an officer said. According to the police, the student said he sent the emails because he did not want to attend school. He used a Virtual Private Net- work VPN to hide his loca- tion and IP address so that the emails could not be traced, an officer said. A police team, a fire bri- gade team and a bomb squad were rushed to the schools after the school ad- ministration discovered the emails. The premises were evacuated first, and then thoroughly searched, but nothing suspicious was found, Noida Deputy Com- missioner of Police DCP Ram Badan Singh said. An FIR was registered on behalf of one school under Sections 212, 3514, 352 of the BNS and 67 D of the IT Act, an officer said.

Displacement of Palesti- nians is one of the most sensitive and explosive is- sues in the West Asia. Forced or coerced dis- placement of a population under military occupation is a war crime, banned un- der the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Israeli strikes which killed tens of thousands of people over the past 16 months have forced Pales- tinians to repeatedly move around within Gaza, seek- ing safety. But many say they will never leave the enclave because they fear permanent displacement, like the Nakba, or catas- trophe, when hundreds of thousands were dispos- sessed from homes in the war at the birth of the state of Israel in 1948, Driven out Many were driven out or fled to Gaza, the West Bank and neighbouring Arab states including to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, where their descendants still live in refugee camps. Israel disputes the account that they were forced out. Mr. Katz said countries who have opposed Israels military operations in Gaza should take in the Palestinians.

   Extracted Text: India-China thaw What fine print of the countries statements says SHUBHAJIT ROY NEW DELHI, JANUARY 29 IN A major diplomatic breakthrough, New Delhi and Beijing have decided on a slew of measures to repair bilateral ties resuming Kailash Mansarovar Yatra this summer, restoring direct flights between the two cap- itals, issuing visas for journalists and think tanks, and sharing trans-border river data, a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs MEA said on Monday. These decisions follow Foreign Secretary Vikram Misris recent visit to Beijing, where he met Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, and Minister of International Department of the CCP Liu Jianchao. While undoubtedly sig- nalling a potential thaw in ties, the fine print of the two countries respective statements reveals some notable divergences. Framing  overall approach On the face of it, New Delhis statementis more nuanced and cautious compared to Beijings, which seems to have a more opti- mistic assessment of the talks. They also highlightthe two countrys overall approach. While the Indian statement emphasises ona step-by-step approach to address areas of interest and concern  referring to the border situation  the Chinese statementem- phasises on a more long term strategy. The two sides took stock of the extant mechanisms for functional exchanges. Itwas agreed to resume these dialogues step by step and to utilise them to address each others priority areas of interest and con- cern, said the Indian statement. In contrast, the Chinese statement said that both sides should view and handle China-India relations on the basis of the fun- damental interests of the two countries and two peoples and froma strategic height and long-term perspective... so as to promote the development of China-India relations along the sound and stable track. Some major developments MANSAROVAR YATRA On Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, the two statements al- most echo each other, but the Chinese state- ment reflects more urgency. The Indian statement said the two sides decided to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025 the relevant mechanism will discuss the modalities for doing so as per existing agreements. The Chinese statement concurred, adding that the two sides will discuss relevant arrange- ments as soonas possible. DIRECT FLIGHTS As many as 539 scheduled direct flights, with a cumulative capacity of more than 1.25 lakh passengers, operated between India and China each month, as of 2019. They were paused dur- ing the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. And fol- lowing the Galwan clash in June that year, they never resumed. On thisissue, acareful reading of the two statements shows that while Delhi wants a new pact, China has linked this to visas and resident journalists. The Indian statement said They agreed in principle to resume direct air services be- tween the two countries the relevant tech- nical authorities on the two sides will meet. and negotiate an updated framework for this purpose at an early date. China said The two sides agreed to re- sume direct flights between Chinese main- land and India, support the competent au- thorities of the two countries to coordinate and push it forward, and take measures to facilitate personnel flows and exchanges of resident journalists. Currently, there is only one Indian resi- dent journalist in China. There is no Chinese journalist in India. TRANS-BORDER RIVERS On trans- border rivers like the Brahmaputra, both sides agreed to hold an early meeting of the India-China Expert Level Mechanism. This will involve sharing of data, which has been anissue in recent times. Beijingin December cleared the construc- tionof the worlds largest dam on the Tsangpo Siang or Brahmaputra in India close to the Indian border, triggering worries in the lower riparian states of India and Bangladesh. New Delhi said it was not informed by the Chinese side about the dam project, something that has long been the conven- tion between the two countries, and learnt of it from media reports. Indian officials then reached out to their Chinese counter- parts about sharing information in advance, and consulting India and Bangladesh. Regular meetings and information sharing at the level of an expert-level mechanism  like the one both sides have agreed to hold soon, can prevent such situations in the future. Notable silences One of the two countries was silent on some key issues, Ontrade, the Indian side spelt outits con- cerns on market access and tariff barriers. Specific concerns in the economic and trade areas were discussed with a view to resolv- ing these issues and promoting long-term policy transparency and predictability, New Delhis statement said. The Chinese state- ment makes no mention of this. Conversely, on SCO, China said The Indian side will extend full support for Chinese presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and will actively participate in the meetings under the SCO umbrella. India makes no mention of this. LONGER VERSION ON indianexpress.comexplained

Sources confirmed that External Affairs Minis- ter S. Jaishankar discussed taking forward infrastruc- ture and trade facilitation initiatives during his visit to the UAE this week. He is also expected to travel to Oman in mid-Fe- bruary for bilateral meet- ings and to address the In- dian Ocean Conference, being organised jointly by the Ministry of External Af- fairs MEA and the India Foundation, where he will meet with about 20 other S. Jaishankar with the UAEs Deputy Prime Minister Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum duringa meeting in Abu Dhabi. Pri counterparts from the re- gion as well. A visit by Qa- tari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad AL-Thani is also being discussed. Diplomatic blitz IMEC will feature promi- nently during next weeks back-to-back Delhi visits by Greeces Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis who will hold Foreign Office consultations, and Egyp- tian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty for a strategic dialogue with Mr. Jaishan- kar. Mr. Abdelatty, who will visit a few weeks after the Gaza ceasefire and the reopening of the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza, is expected to share his views on the reconstruction of Gaza during his visit to India. Prime Minister Naren- dra Modi is also expected to discuss the IMEC project with French President Em- manuel Macron on his visit to France for the Artificial Intelligence Summit bet- ween February 10 and 12, and with new U.S. Pre dent Donald Trump during avvisit to Washington that is still being planned. Official and diplomatic sources said that while no specific moves on the pro- ject were being discussed at present, hopes for a sta- ble and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and the region had grown in the past few weeks. However, they con- ceded that it would be diffi- cult to pick up the diplo- macy over IMEC between Israel and Arab countries until there was some kind of commitment from the Netanyahu government re- garding talks for a two- state solution, which seemed unlikely for now. Greek optimism The Greek government has been keen to move ahead on the project, and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has touted IMEC as a key element of the In- dia-Greece Strategic Partnership. The war in Gaza and turmoil in the Middle East is undoubtedly destabilis- ing but it does not under- mine the powerful logic be- hind IMEC. Nor should it weaken our resolve to work towards realising it, Mr. Mitsotakis had said during a visit to Delhi in Fe- bruary 2024. Officials in Delhi and Athens said they expected to take the dis- cussions on IMEC forward during Mr. Gerapetritiss visit, expected from Febru- ary 5 to 7. The Greek Fo- reign Minister is one of the few leaders to have visited both Tel Avivand Ramallah since the October 2023 at- tacks, and as a member of the UN Security Council this year, Greece occupies a key position on hopes to resolve the conflict. Mr. Abdelatty, is also ex- pected to discuss the pro- ject, although officials said the Egyptian government had been unhappy with the IMEC announcement, as they saw it as a geopolit- ical and commercial rival to the Suez Canal.

   Extracted Text: Four years on, Myanmar and its continuing nightmare February 1, 2021, Myanmar, the sick man of Southeast Asia, continues to traverse a dismal path. The nation is fragmenting there is no peace and stability the economy is in ruins the people are suffering and the international community has other headaches to worry about. Myanmars deepening crisis has been forgotten or ignored by most nations, except perhaps the member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN and neighbours such as, China and India. F our years after the military coup on Astocktaking The past four years have brought armed battles to homes, villages, and cities, with government troops fighting against their own people, represented by a variety of ethnic armed organisations EAOs and peoples defence forces PDFs in all parts of the country  north, south, east and west, not excluding the heartland where the majority Bamar community lives. The resistance is broadly coordinated by the unrecognised National Unity Government NUG. The costs of conflict are high. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners AAPP estimated that, as of January 29, 2025, the military arrested 28,405 people, of whom 21,683 were still detained, and that it killed 6,224 people with around 2,900 treated as need to be verified killed persons. Besides, over 3.3 million people are now internally displaced across the country. Independent sources have spoken of indiscriminate attacks and unlawful killings by the junta that are characterized by their brutality and inhumanity. It should also be recognised that four years of continuous fighting have done untold damage to military personnel, resulting in Killings, injuries, desertions, and a general loss of morale. The junta is entering the fifth year of military rule, wrote Professor Zachary M. Abuza of the National War College, Rajiv Bhatia is a Distinguished Fellow at Gateway House, a former Ambassador of India to Myanmar, and the author of india Myanmar Relations Changing Contours The deepening crisis in the country seems to have been forgotten or ignored by most nations Myanmar is fragmenting Washington DC, with its power rapidly slipping away. The junta forces and the resistance are thus locked in a ceaseless war of attrition in which neither side can be a victor. Meanwhile, the country stands divided into three zones, The central part remains broadly under military control. Peripheral areas are generally with the resistance. Armed battles with, and aerial bombardments by, the military occur in civilian regions located in both zones. Inner demons continue to haunt the people of Myanmar. ASEANs role The crisis began in early 2021 when the military did not like the results of the elections held in November 2020 that gave Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy victory. The 10-year-old experiment in limited democracy was rudely terminated as tanks rolled into the streets. Now, to end the impasse, the militarys preferred way out ironically is to hold another election. The generals tried to do this last year, but they failed. The question is, can they succeed this year? With at least half the country outside their control, elections, if held, will not represent the views of the entire populace. Besides, if they are organised under the present conditions of continuing violence and suppression, will they confer legitimacy on the next government that must necessarily be friendly to the military? Doubts exist. Notably, United Nations experts led by Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, offered a forthright view. You cannot hold an election when you deposed a democratic government in an unconstitutional coup and continue to arbitrarily arrest, detain, disappear, torture, and execute opposition leaders, they warn. The notion that elections will resolve the political crisis is considered delusional by seasoned observers. However, the UN has outsourced the responsibility of mediation to ASEAN. ASEAN did what it could, but its Five-Point Consensus SPC remains stillborn because the cessation of hostilities and the commencement of national dialogue are unacceptable to the warring parties. Recently, ASEAN Foreign Ministers advised the millitary government to prioritise dialogue over holding elections, but this has been brushed aside. The neighbours in the picture The UN and ASEAN are unable to resolve matters for Myanmar. In that case, some experts argue that the nations neighbours, China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Laos, must do something tangible, considering that the ongoing crisis directly threatens their interests. But there are challenges Myanmars borders with India and Bangladesh are now controlled by EAOs, not the government there is a lack of trust between India and China and India-Bangladesh relations are under serious stress. Therefore, the neighbours are unable to develop an internal consensus on how to persuade the government and opposition to move from conflict to peace. Thailand, the only big neighbour and an ASEAN member, is uniquely positioned to help, but it faces limitations that it cannot overcome. Meanwhile, China has substantially increased its influence since the coup. It will continue to be a dominant player, especially as the West shows declining interest in Myanmar. China is the only outside power with the means, capacity, and motivation to influence in Myanmars internal conflicts, wrote Bertil Lintner recently. Hence, the inescapable conclusion is that the people of Myanmar should stop hoping that help will come from the outside. If their leaders are unable to talk rather than let their guns do the talking, sadly, they, the people, will continue paying a hefty price for their leaders folly.

For a foreign correspon- dent in Mali, the assign- ment seemed like a dream as Islamic extremists upended the region, Oli- vier Dubois, a French jour- nalist, secured a rare inter- view with a leader of JNIM, an al-Qaidas affiliate in the Sahel. Or so he thought. En route to the interview in Gao, northern Mali, in April 2021, Mr. Dubois, a correspondent for Libéra- tion and Jeune Afrique pu- blications, was kidnapped. He spent 711 days in des- ert captivity, sleeping chained to a tree, eating dried goat meat and plot- ting his escape. Nearly two years after his release, he recounts his ordeal in a book released Thursday in France. One of the main factors that helped me resist and survive was telling myself JNIM has been sible for most of 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, says ACLED that I am a journalist, Mr. Dubois said.

Mr. Dubois said he knew his project was risky, but that he trusted his fixer too much and ignored the warning signs. Im not sure, he said of the circumstances sur- rounding his kidnapping. I think it was a betrayal. But the motive is not yet clear Kidnappings have sky- rocketed in the Sahel in re- cent years, according to data from the U.S-based Armed Conflict Location  Event Data Project, or ACLED. JNIM, the Sahelian branch of al-Qaida, has been responsible for most of the 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, according to the ACLED. The group relies on ransom money to fund their operations and on the fear they instill on local populations to keep them in check. Mr. Dubois recalled be- ing told he would be re- leased quickly if his fami- ly and government did as instructed. Mr. Dubois was released on March 20, 2023, in Agadez, Niger.

Only my family knew, said Mr. Hadid. In light of the December 8 ouster of Bashar al-Assad, we can talk at last, he said. On February 2, 1982, amid an information black- out, Assads father and then leader Hafez launched a crackdown in Hama in central Syria against an armed Muslim Brotherhood revolt. The banned movement had tried two years earlier to assassinate Hafez, and his brother Rifaat  was tasked with crushing the uprising in its epicentre. No one spared Survivors who witnessed extrajudicial executions said that the crackdown spared no one, with go- vernment forces killing men, women and children. The death toll of the 27 days of violence has never been formally established, though estimates range from 10,000 to 40,000, with some even higher. Lhad no ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, I was at school, said Mr. Hadid, now in his sixties. But my father was al- ways very afraid for me and my brother, he said.

Forty-three years later, Bashar al-Assads ouster opened the way to gather- ing testimonies and comb- ing the archives of Syrias security services. In 1982, Camellia Bou- tros worked for Hamas hospital service, managing admissions. The bodies arrived by truck and were thrown in front of the morgue. Dead, dead, and more dead. We were overwhelmed, said Ms. Boutros, now an actor. Bodies bearing identity cards were registered by name, while others were recorded as unknown and classified by neigh- bourhood, she said. Mr. Boutros said the toll was 7,000 soldiers, around 5,000 Muslim Brotherhood members, and some 32,000 civilians. The Brotherhood is a conservative Sunni Muslim organisation with a pre- sence around the region, while the Assads, who stem from the minority Alawite community, pur- ported to champion secularism. Over more than half a century of rule, the Assads sowed terror among Syr- ians, imprisoning and tor- turing anyone even sus- pected of dissent. Mohammed Qattan was just 16 when he took up arms with the Fighting Vanguard. He was arrested in February 1982 and jailed for 12 years. When Bashar al-Assads 2011 crackdown on pro-de- mocracy protests sparked war, Mr. Qattan joined an armed group, eventually seeking exile in Turkiye. He returned home after As- sads ouster last month.

   Extracted Text: NARAYANAN V Chennai, January 5 THE CHETAK ELECTRIC scooterhas been a big winner. Its maker Bajaj Autonotched upan enviable share of 25 in the electric two-wheeler 2W space in Decemberleaving Ola Electricwith a share of just 19 and Ather with 14. With TVS Motors share at 23, the ICE internal com- bustion engine players are making the switch to EVs remarkably well. The market, however, shrank with total E2W sales falling sharply to 72,090 units in December from 1.39 lakh units in October and 1.19 lakh units in November. Its been a rough ridefor Ola Elec- tric which, even in April 2024 enjoyed a 5 2 share of the market, at the time Bajajs share was just 11. Bajajs success can be credited toa strategic pivot to the mass mar- ket and the addition of dealers to its network. Ola was the first to intro- duce a range of scootersbelow the 1 lakh mark, a segment into which Bajaj and TVS had not ventured. The company, which revived the iconic Chetak brand forelectric scooters in 2020, had been focused on the pre- mium segment pricingitsvehicles at more than 1.2 lakh. In June 2024, however, Bajaj shifted gears launch- ing the Chetak 2901, priced at 96,000 to target the sub-1 lakh mass market. Its monthly sales vol- umes, which were clocking just over 7,500units in April nearly tripled to 18,035 units by December. In fact, thee-scooter market, ini- tially dominated by the premium segment, tilted toward mass-market products inthe latterhalf of theyear. Affordable modelsthat offerreduced range, lower top speed, slower accel- eration, and basic consoles and now account fora majorshare of sales for the top three. Industry estimates suggest Bajaj now commands 36 of the sub-1 lakh market, a seg- ment that was once Olas domain. It is not as though Bajaj Auto has alto- getherabandoned thepremium seg- ment. Lastweek,two newversions of the Chetak electric scooter3501 and 3502under the latest 35 series, were introduced. The vehicles were priced above 1.2 lakh and complement existingmodels suchas FINANCIAL EXPRESS LAUNCH OF MASS MARKET SCOOTERS PAYS OFF Bajaj Autos EV charge IN JUNE 2024, BAJAJ SHIFTED GEARS LAUNCHING THE CHETAK 2901, PRICED AT 296,000 TO TARGET THE SUB-1 LAKH MASS MARKET IN FIRST POSITION 100 80 FY 18 Sd EL ee EU pi wu ie Fa a 2 Ey 20 rs id Ed Py o Jan Feb Mar Apr Market share  Ola Electric Bajaj Auto mTVS Motor May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Others Source Vahan the 3201,3202,2903,and the 3201 Special Edition. To sell its widerrange of products, Bajaj has been expand- ing its sales network. Chetak scoot- ers are now sold through 3,000 touch points, compared to TVS Motors 750 touch points. Bajaj plans to expand this network to 4,000 by January 2025. Moreover, the company is also tapping into e- commerce channels to boost sales. Mon, 06 January 2025 https epaper. financialexpress. comc76563350 For instance, Flipkarthas been offer- ingdiscounts of up to 7,000 on the Chetak 3202, along with flexible EMI options. Bajaj has reportedly sold over 10,000 Chetak scooters via Amazon and Flipkart since 2023. Meanwhile, Bajaj is leveraging its captive financing arm Bajaj Auto Credit. Financing has become a cru- cial driver of the two-wheeler mar- ket, especially for electric scooters with higher price points. Hemal NThakkar,Senior Practice Leader, Crisil, observes that about 50 of 2-wheelers are financed today compared with 30-35 pre- Covid. Traditional OEMs have a clear advantage due to their long- standing relationships with financ- ing companies, perceived product quality, and after-sales value, he adds. Over 70 of Bajajs stores are integrated with its financing arm and credit facilities will be made available to all outlets by end-Janu- ary. About 34 of its electric scoot- ers and 50 ofits ICE vehicles are financed through this channel. Bhavish Aggarwals Ola Electric, meanwhile, has been struggling to regain share plagued bya surge in customer complaints about poor after-sales service. Late September last year the company switched toa multi-brand dealer network that would complement its direct-to- consumer D2 sales model invest- ments to be made the partners would be limited. Essentially, the retailers would not bear the cost of the inventory, which typically accounts for 25-30 of the total cost of a traditional dealership. The tabforthemarketing and promotion costs would be picked up by Ola. The company has added 3,200 new stores, taking its total network to 4,000 showrooms and service cen- ters nationwide. Ola got offtoa fairly good start in 2024 strong,selling1.2 lakh units in the first quarter. There- after, sales volume started falling and volumes in Q2 sales were down to 1.08 lakh units and in the Sep- tember quarter to 94,171 units. By the last quarter of the year, volumes had dropped off tosub-85,000 units. Experts say the company needs to address the issue of after-sales service before it can see a meaning- ful pick-up in volumes. Jeffery Jacob, Partner and Head Automotive at KPMGin India, points out that while the D2C model helps new players scale up quickly, it is the physical store network that ensures sus- tained sales and helps address ser- vice concerns. Over 2024, Ola sold 4.07 lakh units while TVS and Bajaj together soldalittle moreat 4.1 lakh units. But it promises to be a whole new space thisyearwith alot more competition. Hondas tipped to make its entry while Hero MotoCorp has just launched variants of its Vida E2Ws V2 Lite 96,000, V2 Plus 81,15 lakh, and V2 Pro 21.35 lakhtar- getting both the sub-81 lakh and pre- mium segments. Others too are readyingto make launchessoit wont be easy for Bajaj tohold on toitsshare. But itmight yet stay the leader.

The technology behind Willow is sophisticated. The chip features 105 qubits  about double the number on Googles previous Sycamore chip.Ithas made strides in error correction,and scaling qubits while maintaining high computational fidelity. The challenge till now for superconducting quantum systems has been noise. Google has demonstrated that usingan error correcting algorithm, called surface code, they could reduce the error on theirsystem. The more qubits they use in Willow, the more they reduce errors, and the more quantum the system becomes. This historic accomplishmentisknown in the field as below threshold -being ableto drive errors down while scaling up the numberof qubits. Each step like this will help us to create practical scalable quantum computers. Anyway, this will be good for further research as real powerful quantum computers are still far away in the horizon.

Dr Rakesh Gupta, seniorconsultant, internal medi- cine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, says This happens due to multiple interre- lated factors in our modern lifestyle. Irregular sleep patterns, often driven by academic pressure, social media use,and screen time before bed, significantly disrupt their natural circadian rhythm. Poor dietary habits, including excessive consumption of processed foods and irregularmealtiming, failto providesus- tained energy throughout the day. Phys- ical inactivity, largely due to sedentary behaviours like prolonged sitting during classes andscreen-based entertainment, reduces stamina and energy levels. Addi- tionally, psychological stressors such as academic perfor- , mance _ pressure, social expectations, and future career concerns contribute to mental exhau tion, which mani - fests as physical DrRakesh fatigue. Environ- Gupta mental factors like pollution and indoor lifestyles with limited exposure to nat- ural light and fresh air can also impact energy levels. The combination of these factors, along with potential underlying health issues like vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency,orhormonalimbalances, creates a perfect storm for chronic fatigue among younger populations How does fatigue manifest itself? Fatigue manifests through a diverse rangeof physical, mental, and emotional symptoms that affect daily functioning. Physically, individuals may experience persistent tiredness despite adequate rest, muscle weakness, headaches, and reduced coordination. Cognitive mani- festationsinclude difficulty concentrat- FINANCIAL EXPRESS fur 09 January 2025 ing, reduced mental clarity often described as brain fog, slower reaction times, and impaired decision-making abilities. Emotionally, fatigue canlead to irritability, mood swings, and decreased motivation to engage in regular activi- ties. People often report feeling over- whelmed by simple tasks that previously seemed manageable.Sleep patterns may beaffected,leadingtocitherinsomniaor excessive sleepinessthroughout theday. Physical performance decreases, with individuals finding ithardertomaintain their usual exercise routines or even complete basic daily activities. Other common manifestations include diges- tive issues, weakened immune system leading to frequent infections, and reduced stress tolerance. Are foot and sole pain merely indicators of fatigue? Pain in feet andsolesis not exclusively anindicatorof fatigue but can be attrib- uted to multiple underlying causes. While fatigue can contribute to foot dis- comfort, these symptoms often indicate structural issues like flat feet, high arches, or plantar fasciitis. Poorfootwear https epaper. financialexpress.comc76558676 choices, prolongedstanding,orexcessive walking without proper support can cause mechanical stress on feet. Medical conditions such as diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, or circulatory problems may also manifest as foot pain. Obesity puts additional pressure on feet, leading to chronic pain. Occupational factors, including jobs requiring long periods of standing or walking on hard surfaces, contribute significantly to foot discom- fort. Sometimes, foot pain can be a sign of systemic conditions like arthritis or gout. Therefore, persistent foot pain should be evaluated professionally to determine the exact causeandappropri- atetreatment approach. When does fatigue become a cause forconcern? Fatigue becomes a serious concern when it persists despite adequate rest and significantly impacts daily function- ing. Waming signs include fatigue last- ingmorethan sixmonths, accompanied by unexplained weight loss, fever, or night sweats. When fatigue interferes with work performance, social relation- ships, or basic daily activities, it requires medical attention. Other red flags include severe morning fatigue that doesnt improve with rest, post-exer- tional malaise lasting more than 24 hours orfatigueaccompanied bynew or worsening physical symptoms. Psycho- logical symptoms like depression, anxi- ety, or persistent mood changes along- side fatigue should prompt professional evaluation. Additionally, if fatigue is accompanied by chronic pain, cognitive difficulties, or signs of organ dysfunc- tion, immediate medical consultation is necessary. The presence of other health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune disorders makes fatigue monitoring particularly important.

On settlement of cases, by courts in favour of the taxpayer, the CBDT shouldwithdrawallappealsin any pending caseinvolvingthesame subject matter within two months, as recom- mended by the Tax Administration Re- form Commission headed by Partha- sarathi Shome. The CBDT should also instruct officials to not litigate on mat- tors that are decided by the SCin favour of any taxpayer. Officials should be penalised forfailingto followthis. India has afailed assessment system anda delayed justice system. We needa transparent tax assessment system that reduces litigation, anda quick resolution process.

In the Indian context, this case raises pro- found questions about how our legal sys- tem should respond to similar tragedies involvingAl.

The chatbot responded in ways that may have deepened his emotional distress rather than alleviating it. This tragic incident highlights the potential dangersofemotionallyintelligent Al sys- tems that are not equipped to handle complex human emotionsresponsibly. Indias legal landscape Alack of specific regulation In India, the legal framework sur- rounding Al is still evolving. Currently, there are no specificlaws governing the useofAlinemotionally sensitive contexts. However, existing laws such as the Infor- mationTechnology Act ITAct, 2000, and theConsumerProtection Actcould poten- tially be invoked in cases where harm is caused by Al-based applications.

Comparing international approaches Lessons for us The US, where Sewells tragedy occurred, is also grappling with how best to regulate Al systems. There are calls for stricter oversight and clearer guidelines on howemotionally intelligent chatbots should interact with users. In Moffatt vs AirCanada, the British Columbia Civil Res- olution Tribunal found Air Canada liable for misinformation given to a consumer by an Al chatbot on its website, and awarded damages. India can leam from global examples by proactively introduc- ingregulations that ensure Alsystems pr otitise usersafety especiallywheninter- acting with vulnerable populations like children and teenagers. Thiscouldinclude requiring platforms hosting Al chatbots toconduct regularauditsand risk assess- ments or mandating that these systems include built-in mechanisms for detect- ingharmful behaviour. Call for collective responsibility While regulatory frameworks are essential,addressing tragedieslike Sewell Setzerlllsrequiresacollective effortfrom allstakeholders, Parents need to monitor theirchildrensonline interactions closely, especially when using emotionally intel- ligent AI systems. Educators and mental health professionals mustraiseawareness about the potential risks posed by these technologies.

To support deposit mobilisation by banks amid the flight of funds from banks to the capital market, banks suggested finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to treat income from fixed depositsat parwith capi- tal gains tax on equities. Currently, FDincomeis taxedas pertheapplic- able income taxslab rates, with the marginal rate being 30 excluding cess and surcharge, sources said. However, short-term capital gains tax rate for listed equity shares held for less than 12 months stands at 20 while the long-term rate is 12.5 for holding above 12months. After the Reserve Bank of India increased risk weightage on bank lending to NBFCs, large NBFCsare now borrowing mostly from over- seas while alarge number of small and mid-sized NBFCs are now bor- rowing from large NBFCs, which is increasing their costs, said Finance Industry Development Council FIDC director Raman Aggarwal.

The stock closed down 4.59 at 22.52.50 on theBSE.Thebrokeragealsoreduced its target price for Zomato by 18, from 335 to 2275. Jefferies said 2025 is likely to be ayear of consolidation forthe com- pany. It had given abuy rating to the stock in November, citing opti- mism over the foodtech majors newly-launched District app. The brokerage has highlighted concems about intensifying com- petition in thequickcommerceseg- ment, where Zomatos Blinkit faces challenges from SwiggysInstamart, Zepto and other emerging players. Jefferies said this competitive land- scape is expected to exert pressure on Zomatos profitability due to aggressive discounting strategies and efforts by its competitors to deepen market penetration. The franchise will face issues onprofitability and may notbe able toachieve consensus estimates on profitability, in our view, Jefferies said. Allthe top players have acceler- ated networkrollouts inthe last few quarters. The top three quick com- merce companies - Blinkit, Insta- mart and Zepto  have also raised fresh funds for expansion. The sec- tor will also see new entrants like Amazon and Reliance. Jefferies said Flipkart Minutes appears to be the most aggressive quick commerce platform at pre- sent Itisproviding the highest per- centage of discounts at 22. It is followed by DMart Ready at 219, and Zepto and Blinkitat 15 each.

The surgeis attributed torisingdemand forIndian TAproductsin majormarkets like the USAand the EUThe industryis optimistic about sustaining this momentum through the rest of the fiscal. India isa significant player inthe global textileand apparel market, ranking as the worlds sixth largest exporterin 2023. The sectoraccounted foraround 8 of Indias total exports in 2023-24.

Unlike voluntary Bureau of Indian Standards BIS norms, QCOs arecompulsory, requiring FINANCIAL EXPRESS e Quality control orders announced for textile products Explainer RO FOR GROWTH Whats holding back our textile  apparel exports? India is looking at 100 billion worth of textile exports by 2030.Ahead of Budget 2025, Chandrima Chatterjee suggests tweaks in the quality control orders for textile products and tackling non-tariff barriers faced by exporters to leverage Free Trade Agreements to the maximum manufacturers, importers and sellers to comply with the prescribed norms. Theintent behind introducing QCOs in textiles for certain man-madeMMF fibres, filaments and yarns is enhancementof product quality. However, the industrys primary concem liesin the implementation approach. Globally, such mandatory quality standards are usually applied top-down, beginning with finished goods. Whereas in India, the focus of quality standards ison raw materials such as fibresand yarns. financialexp.epapnin Wed, 08 January 2025 https epaper. financialexpress.. comc76581373 e Are QCOs posing any challenges? THE PRESENT APPROACH has limited the supply of certain raw materials as many overseas suppliers are yet to receive BiScertification. Though exemptions for importsbyAA, SEZand EQUunitsare allowed, these provisionsapply only to physical exports,not intermediate supplies. The manufacturers of certain specialised downstream products who are dependenton imports of such raw materials due to non-availability domestically interms of required quality and quantity have takena hit.This might lead toa flood of imports of the next productin the value chain, suchas fabric and garments, which will affect the interest of the domestic manufacturers. Assuch, there isa dire need to re-evaluate the policy regarding the QCOsand an impact assessment needs to bedone before announcing any further QCOs.To meet the objective ofhaving quality finished goods,QCOs maybe started from the garments. e Fibre prices,sops for investment INDIAN FIBRE PRICES, including that ofcotton and MMF are 12 to 30 higher than thoseavailable to competitors. That percolates downthe value chain, resultingin the erosion of the cost-competitiveness of the gatmentsand made-ups.The government needs to ensure raw material availabilityat internationally competitive prices by removing import duty fromall cotton vatieties asalso liberalising the import policy forMMFfibres. Following the discontinuationof the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme TUFS, thereisalack of investment incentives for MSME units, which constitute the majority of the industry. MSMEs require TUFS- likeschemeswith upfront.capital subsidiesand simplified procedures to ensure capacity building, particularly indownstream segments,toattract more investments. e Leveraging free trade agreements FOR THETEXTILE and apparel sector, Free Trade Agreements FTAs provide tariff concessions, better market access, anda level-playingfieldagainst global competitors. Recently India has signed tradeagreements with important TA markets suchas the UAE,Australiaand Mautitiusandhasalso signed a pact with the European Free Trade Association EFTA.The industry is particularly keen on finalising the FTA with the EU, the second-largest export destination for Indian TA products. Tomaximise the benefits of FTAs,the government may also negotiate on the various non-tarifftechnical barriers that Indian exporters might be facingwhile expotting to these countries. For instance, theEUand the UKare coming upwith stringent quality measures at the same time, the Indian government through the BIS isalso coming with standards thatareat parwith international norms.Bothsidesmay negotiate formutual recognition of testing and quality normswhichwill furthercatalyse bilateral trade.
